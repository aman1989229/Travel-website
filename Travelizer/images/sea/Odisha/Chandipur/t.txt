Chandipur is one of the popular family holiday destinations in Odisha. Its sprawling golden sands, plush green coastal vegetation, and transparent waters create a scenic picture. However, it is best known for the ‘hide-and-seek’ nature of the beach. The water here recedes up to 5 km during low tide twice a day and gets back to the original shoreline during high tide.
